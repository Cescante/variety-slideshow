A pan-and-zoom image slideshow
==============================

Written in Python using Clutter (via PyGObject).
Similar to the photo collage slideshow on OSX.

This will eventually be part of Variety Wallpaper Changer (https://launchpad.net/variety).
I am developing it here as a standalone project until it reaches some decent state.
